Value Proposition for Smart Hotspot (EID 101D: Smart, Connected Devices)

Customer Segment -- International visitors in New York City, between a younger age range of 18-35, looking to stay for a short period of time (1-4 weeks) in the city, who do NOT already have a carrier in the United States (such as AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile). 

Pains -- Due to the short duration of their stay in New York City, these visitors are often forced to use the free Wi-Fi restricted to their hotels and do not have any Wi-Fi access outside the hotel. Being tourists/businessmen, they spend the majority of their time outside the hotel, and once again, without any internet access. 

Preliminary interviews conducted at popular tourist spots like Times Square and the Highline indicate that these visitors do not go for typical carrier contracts due to the high costs associated with them and the relatively complex paperwork involved. Most carriers also ask for a relatively large deposit since they do not have Social Security numbers, not being US citizens/permanent residents. This is a huge put-off, since according to these visitors, losing this deposit in the beginning of this stay to the carrier and then regaining it towards the end of the stay is tantamount to it being of no use for them to use for tourism/business. 

Mobile hotspots are also sold, but these visitors typically do not know where to buy these hotspots from or do not want to go through the paperwork/ find them inconvenient to carry around due to their design. 

Features of our device (Gains) : 

1)	Minimized paperwork/contract signing. The rental policy on the hotspot is flexible, and the process is quick. Customers merely have to pay the cost of their chosen data plan upfront, along with a deposit (however, much smaller than that commercial carriers ask for). Since 90% of these visitors will be leaving NYC using the airport, they can simply return the device on their way out of the country. 

2)	Lightweight and Strong. The device itself is made with light-weight aluminum, which is airline standard and hence extremely strong. 

3)	Waterproof. This ensures that the visitors have continued wi-fi access even in the temperamental weather of New York City. 

4)	Smooth design- The design of the hotspot is like a very thin cylinder, and hence it slides into most pockets very conveniently. It can also be safely placed in a backpack. A keychain is attached to the hotspot to let the tourist clip it on to his belt loop and then place it inside the pocket. The round design ensures a very convenient slide in/out. 

5)	Battery life -- Lithium ion batteries that can be recharged with your laptop through USB or with a quick charger (sold separately) that charges the hotspot up to 70% battery in 15 minutes. Also, device automatically shuts off when connection not being used for 2-3 minutes. 

6)	Amplifying design -- The combination of the circular design and the metal used to build this hotspot automatically strengthens the signal and maintains a steady connection with little variance in signal strength. (Needs more research).

7)	Economically priced -- The price is lower than market products using the same data plan, but the materials used are low cost to ensure a >50% margin. 

8)	Location -- Very convenient, at the airport, visible when they are walking out of the terminal. 

9)	Data plan -- Varied data plans exist, and customers can choose whichever one best accommodates their duration of stay in New York City. There is LTE speed for the fixed GB of data they choose, and after they exhaust this, they have unlimited access to data at 3G speeds. 

Future Plans - 

1)	Preliminary design of the product (just the cylinder with the buttons and display) using CAD and rendering using a 3-D Printer. (By Thursday) 

2)	Go to Times Square/ The HighLine and talk to visitors, quickly going over the features and showing them the product, and asking for their opinions. (On Friday) 

3)	Deciding the carrier Â¨C It has to be one which is a GSM carrier, since only those provide sim cards, unlike CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint. This narrows it down to AT&T and T-Mobile. (Weekend)
