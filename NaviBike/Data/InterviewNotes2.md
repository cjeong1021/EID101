3) What are some problems have faced when travelling in NYC? Ex) Getting lost etc. 
×  No wifi on phone
×  Loudness—people talk loudly
×  Drugs—seeing people with drugs on the street—feels uncomfortable and unsafe
×  No links between “Top Tens” (the apps suggesting places for tourists) and maps
×  Crowdness and No bike lanes, would like to bike if the bikers’ safety is protected (in Netherland everyone bikes)

4) In NYC, what type of navigation do you use?
Google maps on phone when WiFi is available;
Actual map to plan where to visit.
Tries to travel around the city in order to feel the city.
 
5) What frustrates you the most about using that type of navigation you mentioned?
Google map has to be used with WiFi;
The combination of actual map and Google map is a bit complicated but they enjoy that.
Plan with Google map, walk with actual map.

6) In NYC, what type of transportation do you use to travel around?
Mainly walking + subway. Cab used just for going to JFK. Tour bus used for once to travel around to visit.

7) What types of problems/concerns have you faced when you used the transportation you mentioned just now? 
No big problems—New York is fast and easy.
Actually, the combination of top tens and maps is not convenient—getting out of subway/cab/bus and finding the direction again.

8) Are you a Smartphone owner? Yes

9)Are you a bike rider?
Yes, in Netherland everyone bikes.

10) If yes, what's the primary purpose of using your bike?
Bikes are used both for leisure time, exercise, and commuting to work. The husband uses mostly for commuting to work, but also bikes for exercise. The wife bikes for leisure and exercise more.

11) Other concerns?
Hope to see an app developed for route of biking that avoids main avenues and crowded areas to make travelling more friendly to bikers. Hope to see audio navigation rather than screen navigations—more convenient the better. Didn’t find Proper Restaurants (maybe add to features of product?)
