INTERVIEW'S on 6th October 2015.  

# Summary of Information 

The Interviews detailed below disprove the hypothesis we based our project on, in assuming that bike ridership would be a preference amongst tourists. Most of them prefer a combination of subway/walking, and the lack of protected bike lanes makes biking in the city not worth risking their life.

# First Interview (Chris)

●	He is from Canada and late 20s 

●	He has been staying in NYC for two days and he is planning to stay for a week 

●	He finds subways quite confusing, but it is cheaper than any other transportations 

●	He is a bike rider at his home country.

# Second Interview (Bob)

●	He is from Russia and plans to live in the city for a week 

●	He is a bike rider and he plans to ride a bike from Queens to Brooklyn because there is a lack of public transportation between those two locations. 

●	He finds subways very crowded, but other than that, he finds it useful to use subways. 

# Third Interview (Bob)
●	He is from a tourist from Germany

●	He relies on Wifi, not personal hotspot in NYC which is very inconvenient. 

●	He wants to save money because buying a carrier for a week is too expensive. 

●	Therefore, he relies on subway and public wifi

●	He is a bike rider and he uses a traditional map to navigate throughout the city. 

●	He wants to ride a bike especially in Central Park, and he looks forward to borrow a bike from a rental place. 

# Fourth Interview (Jai)

·         He is from China, here on a 3 week vacation to tour the city.

·         He has never travelled to New York City before, this is his first time.

·         He mostly walks around wherever he has to go (appears very fit) but for long distances, he prefers taking the subway even though it is a little difficult to navigate and expensive. He finds that the subway is unexpectedly delayed and can get very suffocating inside due to the crowd.

·         He uses Google Maps on his smartphone (iPhone 6), but he finds some aspects frustrating such as occasional errors in navigation.

·         He is a bike (bicycle) rider in China, it is rather popular where he stays. He would love to find an economical rental for a bicycle, but he finds the prospect of biking in New York City scary due to his unfamiliarity with the city and its unsafe regions, and the huge amount of cars compared to bike lanes.

# Fifth Interview (Jai)

·         He is from London, on an internship, and he does want to enjoy all the tourist spots of the city before heading back home.

·         This is his first time in NYC. 

·         He always takes the subway wherever he has to go, as he finds it cheap and convenient. He has also used the NYC tour buses once and quite enjoyed the experience.

·         He uses Apple maps (I was surprised, and upon asking why), he says that it works very well with his iPhone in the US, but he uses Google maps back in England.

·         He uses public transport such as buses back home to commute to university and work.

·         He would prefer not to bike in the city because he feels it can be extremely exhausting and he wouldn’t wanna pass through some of the more “risky” neighborhoods.

# Sixth Interview (Jai)

·         She is a local in New York City, appearing to be in her mid 20’s.

·         She has been living in the New York City for the past 7 years.

·         She uses a combination of MTA buses, subway and walking to get to her destination, though her first preference is to walk.

·         She finds the subway claustrophobic, and hence prefers to walk if she can or take an MTA bus, but the latter is expensive.

·         She used physical maps when she first arrived in NYC, but now she keeps pictures of MTA subway maps on her smartphone and uses Google Maps to navigate.  

·         She would never choose to bike in New York city because there are no “protected” bike lanes.

·         After informing her a bit about my idea, she said that she liked the audio based concept but found it redundant given that one wouldn’t choose to bike at all since there are so few protected bike lanes, allowing easy accidents and fatalities with motor vehicles, explaining the vulnerability of being completely exposed on a bike versus steel cars that can seriously injure you in a myriad of ways. She also said that motorists and pedestrians are not big fans of cyclists here. 

·         She used to be a bike rider where she originally came from, but discontinued that practice here due to above reasons.
