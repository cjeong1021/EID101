Our project is to create a personal navigation device (PNS) that gears toward biking tourists who cannot afford to avert their eyes from the road. PNS¡¯s all over the market work toward getting customers from destination A to destination B in the most efficient way possible. There are many such devices that try to accomplish the same thing, from different GPS systems to old-fashioned maps on smartphones. One example of this device was in an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers journal; a PNS was tested to use an algorithm to find the best possible route, integrating multiple variables such as arrival, departure and detours.

Our product will be connected using Bluetooth technology. Many devices have already integrated this technology, ranging from headsets and speakers, to printers and watches. We will be using similar technology to connect our headset-like product through Bluetooth to a smartphone to allow transfer of navigation data. According to the Bluetooth Development page

(https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/Technology-Overview.aspx)

Bluetooth data transfer is achieved through the communication between an RF transceiver, baseband, and protocol stack. However, there are cheap USB Bluetooth dongles sold that basically achieve the same task. These dongles cost less than 10$ and is good for our focus to keep the cost low and the product readily available to consumers. 

According to nyc.gov, 52.7 million people came to visit New York City in 2012. There is a huge sample size for any surveys that we may want to do to gather information about how our device appeals to our audience. Popular tourist attractions are good places to collect data, especially with the hectic environment of NYC that may leave people confused and lost.  We can distribute our product by finding a retailer or selling online. Finding a retailer that deals with technology, such as Best Buy, is a good way to distribute the product, as they focus on selling technological devices, which our product falls under. We can also distribute our product through online sales and shipping it using websites such as eBay.
