1. Title & Our Picture- an introduction 

Good morning.  We are from EID 101D: Smart, Connected Devices. I am Bob and this is Jai, our  members: Jimmy, Paul, and Chris. 

Slide 2 (Bob) 

2. Explain where we started (Bob)

More than 500,000 people ride bicycles frequently in New York City. However,  It can be dangerous to navigate through the city while riding and looking at the screen at the same time.  especially for  out of state and international tourists. 

So, we came up with an idea. It was  an audio wireless navigational device. So that bikers can  keep their eyes on the road by hearing commands from a bluetooth earphone connected to your smartphone app.

3. Customer Segment (Bob)

Then, we thought about who will be using this product. We thought the navigation is more useful for people who are not familiar with the city. Therefore, our customer segment comprises of international, middle class, smartphone owning tourists, broadly between the ages of 18-45. 

4. Pains (Bob) 

Then, we thought about their  possible pains tourists may face. Firstly of all, 
Tourists come to New York City, solely relying on Hotel Wi-Fi. They typically do not go for domestic carrier plans due to expensive contracts, and it¡¯s cumbersome. . Additionally, cabs are expensive, and subway removes the iconic views of the city. On the other hand, tourists who are willing to ride bikes are often  put off by safety issues: 1. sketchy neighborhoods 2. lack of protected bike lanes. 

5. Gains (Jai) 

Therefore, beyond the audio navigation feature, we decided to make a waterproof earpiece with a temporary sim card, allowing a hotspot to connect with the tourists smartphone and google maps. We also added a feature called ¡°Crime check¡± that would actively connect with an online NYPD database to inform them of crimes in the vicinity.  We also added rentals to economize the product.

6. Interview process (Jai) 

So, we conducted interviews at the Highline and Times Square to gather data to identify their true pains. 
Many tourists had to rely on physical maps due to no carriers. But, nobody mentioned either bikes or bike problems unless we specifically mentioned biking.

(Show PC 1 - Forms of transportation)- As you can see, very few people choose to ride bicycles, only 1 out of 9 tourists.

Secondly, 7 out of 9 tourists rode a bike in their home country but only 2 chose to ride a bike in NYC, preferring subway and walking. 

(Change slide) 

We overlooked the importance of bike lanes. Most people found the idea of bike riding in the city scary, since protected bike lanes are scarce and bikers need to share the road with drivers. 

So we concluded that our solution wasn¡¯t matching the priorities of the customer segment.

7. Future plans (Bob)

At this stage, we must conduct more customer interviews from the same customer segment. However, we must reexamine their true pains clearly shown by their interviews and design a product that could solve their problems. Although, we have abandoned our original idea, we are still interested in navigation, but if their pains are not related to navigation, we will look into that as well. Thank you.
