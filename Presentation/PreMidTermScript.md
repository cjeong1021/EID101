I.	Introduction (Jai) 

A.	Hello, everyone, we are the navi-bike group from EID 101 section D 
B.	I am Jai, Jimmy, Paul, Chris, Bob
C.	For the last a few weeks, we have been working on finding a particular  customer segment, identifying their pains and how we can solve their problems by smart connected devices for their gains. 
D.	Now, Chris will be introducing our customer segment and problems that they face

II.	Pains/Interview (Chris) 

Our group chose international tourists as the focus of our project. We all think that traveling in NYC is difficult due to its confusing and congested public transportation, especially to people who are not familiar with getting around in the city. To confirm that tourists were having trouble traveling to their destinations around the city, we went to popular tourist spots such as the High Line and Time Square to conduct interviews. 

---------
	In these interviews, we confirmed the problems international tourists faced during their time in NY. Many people we interviewed found the idea of bike riding in the city scary, since bike lanes are scarce and bikers basically need to share the road with drivers. Another problem a tourist from Germany had was that he relied on physical maps to find his way around because he could not access the internet unless he was connected to free WiFi that was provided by restaurants, hotels, etc. Another tourist from London was worried about traveling through risky neighborhoods and stumbling into dangerous areas. 
	
	Next, Bob will explain the goal of our project which is to appeal to these potential customers by taking all their problems, alleviating their troubles and making traveling more efficient

III.	Gains/Product Description (Bob) 

As we have seen the pains of international tourists, now it¡¯s time for us to address solutions to alleviate their problems one by one using our future product, which includes audio navigation connected to a bluetooth earphone of smartphones  and other valuable features. 

First of all, our navi bike will have the ability to navigate throughout the city without having to look at a navigational screen. As a result, this will keep their eyes on the road and keep them alert.  

Secondly, for international tourists who are having troubles with finding a carrier for the internet, Navi Bike will solve their problem by providing a wifi hotspot inserted into our product. 

Thirdly, some tourists also have mentioned that they are not willing to ride bikes due to dangerous places in NYC. Well, our navi bike, will have a crime check feature that will warn bikers around unrecommended areas. 

Lastly, we allow our navi bike to be waterproof so that it could be used at any time even during rains/snows. 

Now, I would like Jimmy to address our future plan and how our project can be executed 


IV.	Future Plan (Jimmy) 

	We need to conduct more interviews figure our whether there are enough customers willing purchase or rent our product or more research on the % of 
	We also need to take a look at our limit which includes technological and cost aspects. 
Thank you for listening and we are Navi Bike
