# Where We Started (NaviBike)

 NYC has a footfall of over 50 million tourists a year, consisting of approximately 42.9 million domestic visitors and 11.4 million international visitors. More than 500,000 people ride bicycles frequently in New York City.

 Initially, we assumed that tourists would face difficulty in navigating while biking and looking at a phone at the same time, and we decided to create an audio navigational device to solve their problem. However, interviews at Highline and Times Square revealed that biking is not the main method of transportation. It was due to the lack of protected bike lanes. Therefore bike navigation is not a true pain of tourists. There is no product market fit.

 Meanwhile, we found that the most popular answer to “what are the major problems you face as a tourist in NYC?” has been the lack of access to reliable wi-fi.

Due to the short duration of their stay in New York City, these visitors are often forced to use the free Wi-Fi restricted to their hotels and do not have any Wi-Fi access outside the hotel. Being tourists/businessmen, they spend the majority of their time outside the hotel, and once again, without any internet access. 

Therefore, we decided to design a portable wi-fi hotspot device, called, “SPOTRA” which stands for hotSPOT + TRAvel.

# Targeted Customer Segment 

Our customer segment could broadly be classified as International visitors in New York City, between a younger age range of 18-35, looking to stay for a short period of time (1-4 weeks) in the city, who do NOT already have a carrier in the United States (such as AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile). 

Those international tourists come to New York City, primarily relying on Hotel Wi-fi to use the internet. But when outside the hotels, they typically do not go for domestic carrier plans due to the expense and inefficiency of buying one, and the detailed contracts required for the relatively smaller time period they spend in the city.  


# Our Product

As stated above, we decided to make a waterproof hotspot device with a temporary sim card, allowing a hotspot to connect with the tourists smartphone. We also added different features including Amplifying design, Data plan, and Lightweight to our product. We also allowed rentals to economize the product.

# Challenges and Competitions Faced

A Hotspot device is something that already exists in the market. T-Mobile indeed, provides a hotspot for $20 a month. However, it requires 2 year contracts and security deposits and SSN requirement, which become deal breakers for tourists. 

SPOTRA, on the other hand, requires no contracts and uses passport information as collateral instead of deposits, giving instant access to LTE data. So, to implement this, we provide a rental service. Tourists can pick up SPOTRA at the primary arrival terminals, choose a plan, use it and return it at a SPOTRA vending machine located at departure terminals.

In addition, SPOTRA fits in pocket very well. It’s waterproof, and has quick charging ability.
