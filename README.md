# Where We Started (NaviBike)

 NYC has a footfall of over 50 million tourists a year, consisting of approximately 42.9 million domestic visitors and 11.4 million international visitors. More than 500,000 people ride bicycles frequently in New York City.

 Initially, we assumed that tourists would face difficulty in navigating while biking and looking at a phone at the same time, and we decided to create an audio based navigational device to solve their problem. However, Interviews at The Highline and Times Square revealed that biking is not the main method of transportation. The lack of protected bike lanes made tourists feel unsafe while biking, and hence bike navigation was not a preferred method. 

Meanwhile, we found that the most popular answer to “What are the major problems you face as a tourist in NYC?” has been the lack of access to reliable wi-fi.

Due to the short duration of their stay in New York City, these visitors are often forced to use the free Wi-Fi restricted to their hotels and do not have any Wi-Fi access outside the hotel. Being tourists/businessmen, they spend the majority of their time outside the hotel, and once again, without any internet access. 

Therefore, we decided to design a portable wi-fi hotspot device, called, “SPOTRA” which stands for hotSPOT + TRAvel.

# Targeted Customer Segment 

Our customer segment could broadly be classified as International visitors in New York City, between a younger age range of 18-35, looking to stay for a short period of time (1-4 weeks) in the city, who do NOT already have a carrier in the United States (such as AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile). 

Those international tourists come to New York City, primarily relying on Hotel Wi-fi to use the internet. But when outside the hotels, they typically do not go for domestic carrier plans due to the expense and inefficiency of buying one, and the detailed contracts required for the relatively smaller time period they spend in the city.  

# WHY MAKE SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS? 

Its true, T-Mobile rents these hotspots out for $20 a month. But, there ARE strings attached, including a 2 year contract, which racks your bill up to $(24 x 20) = $580. The security deposit is another $200 since most international visitors do not have a Social Security Number, which gives you a bill of $780. Not so wise, is it? 

# Our Product

So, we decided to make a portable hotspot device with a temporary sim card, to allow the tourists reliable LTE data on the go in all 5 boroughs of New York. Our hotspot comes with exclusive features, such as a compact sturdy and lightweight design, water-resistant and with quick charging ability that charges the hotspot up to 70% in 15 minutes or less. SPOTRA is also sold exclusively on a rental basis, such that you can pick it up on your way out of the airport, choose your plan, pay for it (NO security deposits and NO contracts!) and return it at a SPOTRA vending machine at the airport on your way out of the city!.
