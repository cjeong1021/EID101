We are a group exploring possible products to address tourist navigation in New York City.

Our original idea involved a wireless earpiece device that would give audio cues to users as they biked through the streets of NYC. Our targeted customer segment was international tourists coming to visit NYC for short periods (two weeks or less), who planned to use bicycles as a frequent form of transportation during their stay.

After conducting customer interviews, we decided to refocus and target a broader customer segment. We are currently looking to conduct more interviews with international NYC tourists in order to come up with a product that would match their needs.
