We are a group exploring possible products to address tourist navigation in New York City.

# Where We Started

 NYC has a footfall of over 50 million tourists a year, consisting of approximately 42.9 million domestic visitors and 11.4 million international visitors. More than 500,000 people ride bicycles frequently in New York City. 
 However,  It can be dangerous to navigate through the city while riding and looking at the screen at the same time.  especially for out of state and international tourists. 
So, we came up with an idea. It was  an audio wireless navigational device. So that bikers can  keep their eyes on the road by hearing commands from a bluetooth earphone connected to your smartphone app. 
Our original idea involved a wireless earpiece device that would give audio cues to users as they biked through the streets of NYC. 

# Targeted Customer Segment 

Our customer segment could broadly be classified as Middle class international Tourists visiting New York City for leisure and sightseeing (Since there are very few lower class tourists due to the high costs of NYC, and the higher classes are uninterested in anything that does not have 4 wheels). NYC has a footfall of over 50 million tourists a year, consisting of approximately 42.9 million domestic visitors and 11.4 million international visitors. The detailed customer segment would be smartphone owning international tourists, who do not already have a carrier in the US, approximately between the ages of 18-45.
Those international tourists come to New York City, primarily relying on Hotel Wi-fi to use the internet. But when outside the hotels, they typically do not go for domestic carrier plans due to the expense and inefficiency of buying one, and the detailed contracts required for the relatively smaller time period they spend in the city.  

# What We Did
After conducting customer interviews, we decided to refocus and target a broader customer segment. We are currently looking to conduct more interviews with international NYC tourists in order to come up with a product that would match their needs.

# Challenges and Competitions Faced

Other products in this field (the “competition”) have many disadvantages: They’re often overpriced, or have a very visually distracting interface, or are bulky gadgets that have to be attached and removed on bikes and could be stolen potentially, or have poor battery life. These “pains” of the customer, we plan to solve by:
	a)	Allowing for a rental option for a period of a few weeks
	b)	Only Audio based navigation through the earpiece
	c)	No potential for this gadget being stolen, since it is always on the person himself and not the bike. 
	d)	Low energy Bluetooth and wi-fi technology, allowing for prolonged battery life. 

Another major challenge, and a very tough question: “How is this different from plugging in earphones and using Google Maps”? Firstly, this requires a carrier connection, which we provide on a temporary basis. Assuming this is taken care of, earphones cannot be used in all weather and are prone to getting tangled. We are still working on diversifying our product to have more features. This would expand the product and clearly distinguish it from google maps such that a comparison would be pointless, and change the status of the good from ordinary to luxury, yet affordable for the middle class. Suggested features are a “crime-check” feature, that uses the hotspot to connect to the NYPD online database of crimes and have the automated earpiece voice inform the rider if they’re entering a neighborhood that’s dangerous at that hour, or if a crime has taken place in the vicinity and include a possible re-route. Additionally, the earpiece is planned to be waterproof, such that it can be used in all weather. 

# Current Status

A very important statistic we are trying to collect is how many international tourists actually tour New York City on a bike, since that would also determine our primary revenue stream. This device can be designed at a reasonable cost, requiring only a partnership with a local carrier, Bluetooth connections to a smartphone and access to Google maps and the internet. If even a small proportion of the 11.4 Million tourists fall into our customer segment, we could still be looking at a large revenue stream due to the sheer number of the tourists. Furthermore, since the range is “middle class”, they would not be looking to spend money on expensive cabs/subway/buses but rather on shopping and sightseeing. We could partner up with bike rentals and provide affordable solutions to this, making it an attractive option. Tourist interviews are planned for this stage.
