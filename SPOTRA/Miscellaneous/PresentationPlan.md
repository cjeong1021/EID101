Breakdown of stuff we have to do for a great grade (not script): 



0) Github- The most key element. Please upload ALL data in an organized manner to Github. Basically just upload stuff in folders headed with the headers in the list below form 1-10, showing all the information that went into the stuff. Example: Brainstorming, Value Props etc.


1. Kickstarter - JAI (Tuesday Deadline) - 


2. Landing Video (curbed to 45 sec - 1 min) CHRIS, PAUL (Wednesday, if possible). Talk to Varouzan Knouni, he worked on the video you guys saw on the backpack group the last class, which was really good and to the point. It had minimal animation, text to the point etc. Or go your own way. 


3. Landing Page (Website) - Remove Fake stuff as Petrillo said - BOB ( Tuesday, and it should be UP with a link to its access) 


4. Value Proposition and Pains/Gains Analysis Presented - ALREADY DONE


5. Preliminary Interviews in Times Square and the Highline - ALREADY DONE


6. Final Interview at John F Kennedy International Airport - ALREADY DONE


7. Final Presentation And Presentation Script - JAI, BOB (Jai - Script Monday, Bob - PPT/ Wednesday)


8. The Prototype Stage - ALREADY DONE


9. Explanation of why we went from Audio Navigation to SPOTRA (Emphasize on how we achieve the class goal of FAILING and then learning from our failures and succeeding).- ALREADY DONE


10. Cost Analysis of Price of Hotspot, Profit Margin, and Kickstarter Goal- Prof. Petrillo said it would be cool if we would do this, since none of the other groups have. If someone can simply do a simple analysis: Add up cost of raw materials, see the cost of a conventional wi-fi hotspot for a particular data plan, leave a decent margin for us, and give me a Kickstarter Funding Goal with No. of devices we plan to produce. - JIMMY/CHRIS/PAUL (Tuesday)

If this all goes according to plan, we should be done with EID 101D by Wednesday.
