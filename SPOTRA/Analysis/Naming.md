FILL IT WITH MEANING
Example: ¡
From a word that initially meant only a stamp on a passport, Visa has surrounded its name with a host of associations—travel, access, opportunities, identity, official status—that allow it to tell the right story at the right time.

SAY IT OUT LOUD 
The best names are the ones that people can’t wait to tell their friends about. Names that roll off the tongue invite customers to become your viral marketing agency.
