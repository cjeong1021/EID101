Tonight - Order hotspot
11/21 @ 11:59 - Solidworks/3D print for hotspot case
11/21 @ 11:59 - Solidworks/3D print for pretty plastic shell
Tues 11/24 @ 11:59 - Sand/paint pretty plastic shell (paint hotspot aluminum, paint LED spots black)
Wednesday 11/25 - Give pretty plastic shell to Bob for website
As soon as the hotspot arrives - Put the hotspot into the hotspot case
Saturday 11/28 - Interview at JFK with both functional/ugly and nonfunctional/pretty
	JUSTIN JOSE IDEA:
	buy a hotspot from verizon, at&t, sketchy dealer, etc.
	make a plastic case that is specially molded to fit on to that specific hotspot
	Leave a hole in the case so we can reach the power button
