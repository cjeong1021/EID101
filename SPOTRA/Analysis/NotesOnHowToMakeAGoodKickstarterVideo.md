# Plan

Tonight - Order hotspot

11/21 @ 11:59 - Solidworks/3D print for hotspot case

11/21 @ 11:59 - Solidworks/3D print for pretty plastic shell

Tues 11/24 @ 11:59 - Sand/paint pretty plastic shell (paint hotspot aluminum, paint LED spots black)

Wednesday 11/25 - Give pretty plastic shell to Bob for website

As soon as the hotspot arrives - Put the hotspot into the hotspot case

Saturday 11/28 - Interview at JFK with both functional/ugly and nonfunctional/pretty

	JUSTIN JOSE IDEA:

	buy a hotspot from verizon, at&t, sketchy dealer, etc.

	make a plastic case that is specially molded to fit on to that specific hotspot

	Leave a hole in the case so we can reach the power button
