NaviBike: Audio-oriented navigation bike designed for tourists going to NYC

Summary
	According to NYC statistics, 54.3 million of tourists (international and domestic) came to NY in 2013, and this number has kept increasing for more than 12 years. How to get around for tours safely and conveniently (and cheaply) is every tourist's problem. A bike is very convenient for moving around NYC, and it is much cheaper than cabs, more flexible than tour bus, and gets more view than the subway. A tour bike would be very helpful in NYC for the tourists.

Competitors
	There are a couple of tour bike organization working currently. However, the design of those tour bikes is the same as regular bikes, differing just by a basket in front of the bike for tourists¡¯ bags. People still have to use their phone searching up in Google Map before they go on for a bike tour, and there is no smart connected devices involved for current tour bikes.

For smart connected bikes, there already exists projects that allows users to link the product to their smartphone navigation, and presents it on the screen. Yet those projects are not do not have great enough design because it works the same as a smartphone, only to prevent the smartphone from falling onto the floor. The navigation is also presented on the screen, similar to what a phone does. A cell phone case that can attach to the hand bar of bike would perform the same work. The problem of those bike¡¯s screen design is that looking at a screen when traveling is always dangerous, especially for bikers who get hit directly with no buffer in a car accident. Navigation with audio would be much safer as the user can still keep track of what is going on the road.

NaviBike Value Prop
	The customers we would be aiming at is the domestic and international tourists coming to NYC. The pains of customers is not just navigation through the city. They also experience the problem of no Wi-Fi/4G connections. In order to gain Wi-Fi tourists would have to stay in a hotel or coffee shop¡ªthey cannot be online and share their fun at the instant they are at tour places. Another problem they experience is unfamiliarity and they would not want to get into dangerous places in the city. Also, the taxis in NYC is extremely expensive comparing to other places, and most tourists would not want to take them. The pains that the tourists are experiencing would obviously be more than these, and we would need surveys or potential customer interviews to gather more information on this. Good places to find tourists to interview would be hotels, tour places, and traveling agencies. We also need statistics on the incidents happening to tourists so we would know how important our crime check feature would be.
	The gains our customers can get from our product is first of all touring navigation through the NYC. They would be able to explore all the fun places in NYC. Second gain for our customers would be safety. Safety come in two features of our product: One is the crime check feature that prevents tourists unfamiliar to the places to travel in the dangerous places in NYC. The second is the audio navigation that provides more safety than a screen navigation. Another gain for our customers is the use of Wi-Fi/4G while traveling around, so that they don¡¯t have to buy a new temporary SIM card just for the few days of traveling. We might need to conduct the process of calling competitors posing as a potential customer in order to gather more information in this area.
